    In single-variable calculus, we can integrate functions of the form 

    \[g'(x)f(g(x))\]

    by 'rephrasing' the entire integral as an integral of \(g(x)\) instead of an integral of \(x\). This is known as substitution. For example, consider the following integral: 

    \[\int x e^{x^2} dx\]

    Integrating this function as it currently is is painfully annoying, and so Leibniz, one of the fathers of calculus, came up with a way to simplify this integral. The first step
    in doing so is to notice that 

    \(x\) can be represented as a derivative of \(x^2\). More precisely, if we let \(u=x^2\), then 

    \[\frac{du}{dx} = 2 x\]
    \[du = 2 xdx\]

    Notice how this is very similar to the \(xdx\) we had in our original integrand, except it has a coefficient of \(2\). It follows, then, 
    that in order for \(du\) to equal \(xdx\), we must divide it by two, 

    \[xdx = \frac{1}{2} du\] 
    
    We can now substitute the variables in our original integral with the new ones, 

    \[\int x e^{x^2} dx = \frac{1}{2} \int e^u du\]

    making the integral trivially easy to solve: 

    \[ \frac{1}{2} \int e^u du = \frac{e^u}{2} + C = \frac{e^{x^2}}{2} + C\]

    Now, if we want to use an analogous process for functions of several variables, how would we do that? <br><br>

    <h3>Change of Variables</h3>
    <p>
    Consider the double integral
    \[\iint_D 3x\sin(6x+7y) - y \sin(6x+7y) dxdy\]

    While this integral isn't impossible to solve, we can greatly simplify the process by employing a change of variables. First, we define the transformation

    \[T: D \rightarrow D^*\]

    such that 

    \[T(x, y) = (u, v)\]

    where \(u=3x-y\) and \(v=6x+7y\). This transformation transforms the domain \(D\) in \(xy\) space to a domain \(D^*\) in \(uv\) space. 
    If \(D\) was the unit square \([0, 1]\times[0, 1]\), for example, the transformation \(T\) would "stretch" or "squeeze" the unit square into a parallelogram with a different area. 
    Keep this notion in mind, as it will be important in the next step (later in the post I give examples of other transformations). <br><br>

    Now that we have our substitutions for \(x\) and \(y\), we can just replace them with our new variables and integrate over the new domain \(D^*\)... 

    \[\iint_D 3x\sin(6x+7y) - y \sin(6x+7y) dxdy \stackrel{?}{=} \iint_{D^*} u \sin v dudv\]

    ... right? 

    Well, not exactly. The problem is that the infinitesimal area \(dudv\) is different than the infinitesimal area \(dxdy\) precisely because the area of the domain as a whole changes 
    after being transformed. In order to fix this, wouldn't it really cool if we had a tool for determining by how much the infinitesimal area \(dxdy\) is scaled when transformed? 
    That's where the Jacobian comes in. <br><br>
    </p>


    <h3>Jacobian Matrices</h3>

    <p>
    The Jacobian matrix of a transformation, or, more precisely, its determinant, tells us exactly by how much the infinitesimal area is scaled. The Jacobian matrix of the transformation \(T\)
    (as defined above) looks like this: 

    \[\left| \frac{\partial (u, v)}{\partial (x, y)}\right| = 
    
    \left| \begin{matrix} 
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \\ 
    \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}
    \end{matrix} \right|\]

    Let's think about why the determinant of such a matrix might give us the factor by which the area is scaled.
