    <p>About a week ago, I read a rather elegant proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra using the fundamental group of a circle. It's among the more surprising proofs I've read. As someone who knows very little about algebra and topology, I'm accustomed to algebraic structures being used to solve topological problems, but this proof bridged the two worlds in exactly the opposite way.</p>

<p>When I first read the proof, I was a little confused, mainly because I didn't understand the motivation behind the methods used. I could follow the logical chain, but I couldn't quite see the forest for trees. So in this post, I'll be taking the proof (taken from <a href="https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf">Hatcher's</a> book) and explaining it in greater detailâ€“primarily as a test of my understanding and communication abililties, but also in the hopes that someone else might find this helpful.</p>

<p>Without further ado, I present to you the fundamental theorem of algebra.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Theorem</strong>. <em>Every nonconstant polynomial with coefficients in <span  class="math">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span> has a root in <span  class="math">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>.</em></p>

<p><strong>Proof Outline:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Assume the polynomial above (denoted <span  class="math">\(p(z)\)</span>) has no roots in <span  class="math">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Define a loop in <span  class="math">\(S^1 \subset \mathbb{C}\)</span> that depends on <span  class="math">\(p(z)\)</span> not having roots in order to be continuous.</li>
<li>Show that this loop is homotopic to the trivial loop in a way that depends on the degree of the polynomial being zero.</li>
<li>Conclude that only polynomials of degree zero (constant polynomials) can have zero roots.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Proof.</em> Assume the polynomial is of the form <span  class="math">\(p(z) = z^n + a_1 z^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n\)</span> (this guarantees that it is nonconstant). If <span  class="math">\(p(z)\)</span> has no roots in <span  class="math">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>, then for each real number <span  class="math">\(r \geq 0\)</span>, the formula</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[f_r (s) = \frac{p(re^{2\pi i s})/p(r)}{|p(re^{2\pi i s})/p(r)|}\]</span></p>

<p>defines a loop in the unit circle <span  class="math">\(S^1 \subset \mathbb{C}\)</span> based at 1. If <span  class="math">\(p(z)\)</span> did have roots, then this loop might be discontinuous (dividing by zero causes problems). As <span  class="math">\(r\)</span> varies, <span  class="math">\(\\\ f_r\)</span> is a homotopy of loops based at 1. Since <span  class="math">\(f_0\)</span> is the trivial loop (it isn't dependent on <span  class="math">\(s\)</span>), the class <span  class="math">\([f_r] \in \pi_1 (S^1)\)</span> is zero for all <span  class="math">\(r\)</span>. Now, fix a large value of <span  class="math">\(r\)</span>, larger than <span  class="math">\(|a_1| + \cdots + |a_n|\)</span> and larger than 1. Then for <span  class="math">\(|z| = r\)</span>, we have</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[|z^n| > (|a_1| + \cdots + |a_n|)|z^{n-1}| > |a_1 z^{n-1}| + \cdots + |a_n| \geq |a_1 z^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n|.\]</span></p>

<p>From <span  class="math">\(|z^n| > (|a_1| + \cdots + |a_n|)|z^{n-1}|\)</span> it follows that the polynomial <span  class="math">\(p_t = z^n + t(a_1 z^{n-1} + \cdots + a_n)\)</span> has no roots on the circle <span  class="math">\(|z| = r\)</span> when <span  class="math">\(0 \leq t \leq 1\)</span>. Replacing <span  class="math">\(p\)</span> by <span  class="math">\(p_t\)</span> in the formula for <span  class="math">\(f_r\)</span> and letting <span  class="math">\(t\)</span> go from 1 to 0, we obtain a homotopy from the loop <span  class="math">\(f_r\)</span> to the loop <span  class="math">\(w_n (s) = e^{2\pi i n s}\)</span> (notice all the terms that disappear when this happens). Remembering that <span  class="math">\(w_n\)</span> represents <span  class="math">\(n\)</span> times a generator of the infinite cyclic group <span  class="math">\(\pi_1 (S^1)\)</span>. Since <span  class="math">\([w_n] = [f_r] = 0\)</span>, it must be the case that <span  class="math">\(n=0\)</span>. Thus, the  only polynomials without roots in <span  class="math">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span> are constant.</p>
