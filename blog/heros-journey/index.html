    <p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about what I want to do with my life, as one does. Thus far, the answer is, <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not entirely sure&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of things I really enjoy doing, but right now it&rsquo;s hard to definitively say what I&rsquo;d like to dedicate the rest of my life to, if anything. Yet, I still have a general, vaguely defined sense of where I&rsquo;d like to end up. So, in an attempt to better define this desire, I sought useful analogiesâ€“ones that would help me communicate it to others and to provide me with some more direction.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Treating your life like a video game where you have to level up your character, go on missions and defeat final bosses is a surprisingly fulfilling perspective</p>&mdash; Adar Kahiri (@AdarKahiri) <a href="https://twitter.com/AdarKahiri/status/1288193221428948992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 28, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>As someone who played a lot of video games when I was younger, I remember spending hours tirelessly acquiring resources, defeating enemies, and becoming more powerful. I also remember almost always feeling a little guilty after having made significant progress in some game, as that &ldquo;progress&rdquo; was obviously meaningless.</p>
<p>Spinning my old pastime into a pseudo-philosophy by which I could live my life was motivating, but I still felt that it was missing something. After some  time, I recalled an archaic archetype that has permeated stories and mythology for millenia: <strong>the hero&rsquo;s journey</strong>.</p>
<p>The hero&rsquo;s journey archetype can be roughly broken down into the following steps  [1]:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>An ordinary world:</strong> You are living your normal life, and are perhaps dissasisfied with some aspect of it, be it personal failures, problems with your relationships, or just the  blandness of it all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A call to adventure:</strong> You are confronted with a challenge or opportunity that is all too appealing. To pursue it is to change the trajectory of your life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Meeting the mentor:</strong> You encounter someone or something that prepares you for the perilous events ahead of you, and imbues upon you a profound insight (or several).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A series of challenges:</strong> Now you actually begin your journey, facing numerous hardships thereafter, and working your way towards your goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The ordeal:</strong> Then, you face the biggest, deadliest challenge of all. One that could very well spell your destruction. By sheer determination, skill, and luck, you not only survive, but triumph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The return:</strong> After unimagineable hardship, you finally achieve your goal. You return home a changed person.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, it describes a process of discovery, adversity, triumph, and transformation. So, what journeys can aspiring heros embark on in the twenty-first century? Here are a few ideas off the top of my head:</p>
<ul>
<li>Running a marathon</li>
<li>Starting a company. Struggling to prevent your company from failing.</li>
<li>Going on a literal adventure (summitting Mount Everest, hunting, serving in the army)</li>
<li>Growing emotionally</li>
<li>Overcoming trauma</li>
<li>Quitting bad habits and addictions</li>
<li>Overcoming an insecurity</li>
<li>Earning a rigorous academic degree</li>
<li>Learning a new skill</li>
</ul>
<p>As you might have noticed, most of these goals aren&rsquo;t necessarily characterized by a hero&rsquo;s journey arc. However, my guess is that characterizing them as such can help frame otherwise difficult times during whatever &lsquo;journey&rsquo; you happen to be on in a positive light and push you to seek new experiences.
y</p>
<p>Even for the most adventurous of us, life usually ends up mostly being a daily slog, with intermittent moments of excitement, failure, and gratification. I&rsquo;m not expecting this metaphor to completely change my trajectory, but so long as it positively changes my perspective, it will have done its job.</p>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<p>* One of the most impactful pieces of advice I&rsquo;ve heard is &ldquo;do it for the story.&rdquo; I like to think of the &lsquo;hero&rsquo;s journey&rsquo; as an extension of that.</p>
<p>[1] The breakdown described here isn&rsquo;t one you might find elsewhere. I simply included the most relevant elements.</p>
