<p class="date">May 18, 2020</p>

    
    <p>In single-variable calculus, we can integrate functions of the form</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[g'(x)f(g(x))\]</span></p>

<p>by 'rephrasing' the entire integral as an integral of <span  class="math">\(g(x)\)</span> instead of an integral of <span  class="math">\(x\)</span>. This is known as substitution. For example, consider the following integral:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\int x e^{x^2} dx\]</span></p>

<p>Integrating this function as it currently is is painfully annoying, and so Leibniz, one of the fathers of calculus, came up with a way to simplify this integral. The first step
in doing so is to notice that</p>

<p><span  class="math">\(x\)</span> can be represented as a derivative of <span  class="math">\(x^2\)</span>. More precisely, if we let <span  class="math">\(u=x^2\)</span>, then</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\frac{du}{dx} = 2 x\]</span></p>

<p><span  class="math">\[du = 2 xdx\]</span></p>

<p>Notice how this is very similar to the <span  class="math">\(xdx\)</span> we had in our original integrand, except it has a coefficient of <span  class="math">\(2\)</span>. It follows, then,
that in order for <span  class="math">\(du\)</span> to equal <span  class="math">\(xdx\)</span>, we must divide it by two,</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[xdx = \frac{1}{2} du\]</span></p>

<p>We can now substitute the variables in our original integral with the new ones,</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\int x e^{x^2} dx = \frac{1}{2} \int e^u du\]</span></p>

<p>making the integral trivially easy to solve:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[ \frac{1}{2} \int e^u du = \frac{e^u}{2} + C = \frac{e^{x^2}}{2} + C\]</span></p>

<p>Now, if we want to use an analogous process for functions of several variables, how would we do that? <br><br></p>

<h3 id="change-of-variables">Change of Variables</h3>

<p>Consider the double integral</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\iint_D 3x\sin(6x+7y) - y \sin(6x+7y) dxdy\]</span></p>

<p>While this integral isn't impossible to solve, we can greatly simplify the process by employing a change of variables. First, we define the transformation</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[T: D \rightarrow D^*\]</span></p>

<p>such that</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[T(x, y) = (u, v)\]</span></p>

<p>where <span  class="math">\(u=3x-y\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(v=6x+7y\)</span>. This transformation transforms the domain <span  class="math">\(D\)</span> in <span  class="math">\(xy\)</span> space to a domain <span  class="math">\(D^*\)</span> in <span  class="math">\(uv\)</span> space.
If <span  class="math">\(D\)</span> was the unit square <span  class="math">\([0, 1]\times[0, 1]\)</span>, for example, the transformation <span  class="math">\(T\)</span> would &quot;stretch&quot; or &quot;squeeze&quot; the unit square into a parallelogram with a different area.
Keep this notion in mind, as it will be important in the next step (later in the post I give examples of other transformations).</p>

<p>Now that we have our substitutions for <span  class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(y\)</span>, we can just replace them with our new variables and integrate over the new domain <span  class="math">\(D^*\)</span>...</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\iint_D 3x\sin(6x+7y) - y \sin(6x+7y) dxdy \stackrel{?}{=} \iint_{D^*} u \sin v dudv\]</span></p>

<p>... right?</p>

<p>Well, not exactly. The problem is that the infinitesimal area <span  class="math">\(dudv\)</span> is different than the infinitesimal area <span  class="math">\(dxdy\)</span> precisely because the area of the domain as a whole changes
after being transformed. In order to fix this, wouldn't it really cool if we had a tool for determining by how much the infinitesimal area <span  class="math">\(dxdy\)</span> is scaled when transformed?
That's where the Jacobian comes in.</p>

<h3 id="jacobian-matrices">Jacobian Matrices</h3>

<p>The Jacobian matrix of a transformation, or, more precisely, its determinant, tells us exactly by how much the transformation scales the infinitesimal area. The Jacobian matrix of the transformation <span  class="math">\(T\)</span> (as defined above) looks like this:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\left| \frac{\partial (u, v)}{\partial (x, y)}\right| = \left| \begin{matrix} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \\ \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \end{matrix} \right|\]</span></p>

<p>Let's think about why the determinant of such a matrix might give us the factor by which the area is scaled.</p>

<p>In the same way that a smooth, continuous function looks more and more like a straight line the more you 'zoom in' on a point,
a smooth, continuous transformation, looks more and more like a linear transformation the more you zoom in. Below is a perfect example:
a non-linear transformation that warps space, but it's not difficult to imagine that as you 'zoom in', which really just means
paying attention only to points around some given point, one could locally approximate this transformation with a linear
one.</p>

<p><figure><img src="/images/nonlinear-transformation.jpg" alt="non linear transformation"></figure></p>

<p>Now, we can take advantage of this fact by considering the infinitesimal area dxdy at some point <span  class="math">\((x_0, y_0)\)</span>:</p>

<p><figure><img src="/images/dxdy.png" alt="dxdy"></figure></p>

<p>If we think of the two columns in the Jacobian matrix as transformations of the basis vectors,</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[T_x = \left[ \begin{matrix} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \\ \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\end{matrix}\right], \ \ \ \ T_y = \left[ \begin{matrix} \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \\ \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\end{matrix}\right]\]</span></p>

<p>then <span  class="math">\(T_x\)</span> tells us how much <span  class="math">\(\partial x\)</span> is scaled and <span  class="math">\(T_y\)</span> tells us how much <span  class="math">\(\partial y\)</span> is scaled.</p>

<p><figure><img src="/images/local-transformation.png" alt="local transformation"></figure></p>

<p>As the diagram shows, <span  class="math">\(\partial u/\partial x\)</span> tells us how much an infinitesimal step in the <span  class="math">\(x\)</span> direction
is scaled in the <span  class="math">\(u\)</span> direction, <span  class="math">\(\partial v / \partial x\)</span> tells us how much a step in the <span  class="math">\(x\)</span> direction
is scaled in the <span  class="math">\(v\)</span> direction, and so on.</p>

<p>Taking the determinant of these two vectors (which together form the Jacobian matrix) essentially gives us
the ratio of area of parallelogram these two new vectors form to the area of the paralleogram the vectors
in <span  class="math">\(xy\)</span> space form, which tells us exactly how much it's scaled.</p>

<p>Multiplying this by <span  class="math">\(dxdy\)</span> in the integrand gives us the 'correctly sized' areas which we integrate. And so,
the 'scaled' integral actually looks like this,</p>

<p><span  class="math">\(\iint_D 3x\sin(6x+7y) - y \sin(6x+7y) dxdy = \iint_{D^*} u \sin v \left|\frac{\partial (u, v)}{\partial (x, y)}\right| dudv\)</span>
<span  class="math">\(= \iint_{D^*} u \sin v \left| \begin{matrix} 
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \\ 
\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}
\end{matrix} \right| dudv\)</span></p>

<p><span  class="math">\(= \iint_{D^*} u \sin v \left| \begin{matrix} 
3 & -1 \\ 6 & 7 \end{matrix} \right| dudv\)</span>
<span  class="math">\(= 27 \iint_{D^*} u \sin v dudv\)</span></p>

<h3 id="applications">Applications</h3>

<p>The most common application of the change of variables method is most likely converting between different coordinate
systems. If we want to evaluate the integral</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\iint_D f(x, y)dxdy\]</span></p>

<p>in polar coordinates, first we define the transformation,
<span  class="math">\(x=r\cos\theta, \ \ \ \ y= r\sin\theta\)</span></p>

<p>then we set up and evaluate the Jacobian</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\left| \frac{\partial (x, y)}{\partial (r, \theta)}\right| = \left| \begin{matrix} \cos\theta & -sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & r\cos\theta \end{matrix} \right| = rcos^2\theta + rsin^2\theta = r\]</span></p>

<p>And finally, we can complete the change of variables:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\iint_D f(x, y)dxdy = \iint_{D^*} f(r\cos\theta, r\sin\theta) \left| \frac{\partial (x, y)}{\partial (r, \theta)}\right|  dr d\theta = \iint_{D^*} f(r\cos\theta, r\sin\theta) r dr d\theta\]</span></p>

<p>And that's how you can use the Jacobian and the change of variables method to greatly simplify solving all sorts of integrals.
I hope you found this helpful!</p>
