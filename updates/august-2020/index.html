<li>I continued studying algebraic topology and algebra. I posted more <a href="http://adarkahiri.com/solutions/">solutions</a>, as well as made my (incomprehensive) <a href="/docs/general-topology.pdf">point-set topology notes</a> available online.</li>
<li>On a related note, my summer reading group with <a href="https://sites.google.com/college.harvard.edu/morph/home">MORPH</a> came to an end. It was a great experience and really enriched my summer.</li>
<li>I ported my personal website to <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a></li>
<li>I practiced writing. I didn&rsquo;t post anything though as I didn&rsquo;t think any of it was of high enough quality.</li>
<li>Lastly, I got my driver&rsquo;s license. Looks like I&rsquo;m another step closer to adulthood now.</li>
