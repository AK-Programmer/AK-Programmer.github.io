      <description>I continued studying algebraic topology and algebra. I posted more solutions, as well as made my (incomprehensive) point-set topology notes available online. On a related note, my summer reading group with MORPH came to an end. It was a great experience and really enriched my summer. I ported my personal website to Hugo I practiced writing. I didn&amp;rsquo;t post anything though as I didn&amp;rsquo;t think any of it was of high enough quality.</description>

      <description>Math stuff. I started learning topology. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Munkres&amp;rsquo;s book on the subject to learn about the fundamentals of point-set topology. I also started reading Hatcher&amp;rsquo;s book on algebraic topology as well as Pinter&amp;rsquo;s book on abstract algebra. My goal is to have a solid foundation in algebraic topology and algebra in a few months. I&amp;rsquo;ve been posting some solutions to problems I&amp;rsquo;ve done in Munkres&amp;rsquo;s book here.</description>
