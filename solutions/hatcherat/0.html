            Problem 10: Show that a space \(X\) is contractible if and only if every map 
            \(f: X \rightarrow Y\), for arbitrary \(Y\), is nullhomotopic. Similarly, show \(X\) is contractible if and only if 
            every map \(f: Y \rightarrow X\) is nullhomotopic.
        </b><br><br>

        <div class="proof">
            I will assume that by 'every map' Hatcher means 'every continuous map'. If \(X\) is contractible, then its identity map 
            \(\mathbb{I}: X \rightarrow X\) is nullhomotopic. Let \(h: X \times I \rightarrow X\) be a homotopy between \(\mathbb{I}\) and a constant map 
            (that's what it means for a function to be nullhomotopic). Then the composite \(fh: X \times I \rightarrow Y\) is a homotopy from \(f\) to a constant map. Conversely, 
            suppose <i>every</i> map \(f: X \rightarrow Y\) for arbitrary \(Y\) is nullhomotopic. Then the identity map falls under this category (we can just set \(Y=X\)), and \(X\) is 
            therefore contractible. <br><br>  

            Next, we show that \(X\) is contractible if and only if every map \(f: Y \rightarrow X\) is nullhomotopic. Suppose \(X\) is contractible. Then we can define a homotopy 
            \(h: X \times I \rightarrow X\) between the the identity and a constant map. It follows that the composite \(hf\) is a homotopy between \(f\) and a constant map (\(h\) is continuous, 
            \(h(f(Y), 0) = f(Y)\) and \(h(f(Y), 1) = c_0\) for some point \(c_0 \in X\). Conversely, if every map \(f: Y \rightarrow X\) is nullhomotopic, then, setting \(Y=X\), the identity map 
            must also be homotopic. <br><br>

            I suspect I didn't use the proper notation here for composing functions where the domains of some functions are products, but the logic still holds (I hope!).
