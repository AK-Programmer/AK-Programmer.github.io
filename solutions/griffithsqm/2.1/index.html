<p class="date">June 2020</p>

    <p><b>Problem:</b> Prove the following three theorems </p></p>

<p><b>(a)</b> For normalizable solutions, the separation constant <span  class="math">\(E\)</span> must be real.
<b>(b)</b> The time-independent wave-function <span  class="math">\(\psi(x)\)</span> can always be taken to be real (unlike <span  class="math">\(\Psi (x, t)\)</span>)
<b>(c)</b> If <span  class="math">\(V(x)\)</span> is an even function (that is, <span  class="math">\(V(x)=V(-x)\)</span>), then <span  class="math">\(\psi(x)\)</span> can always be taken to be either even or odd.</p>

<p><b>Solution: </b></p>

<p><b>(a)</b> We have the wave-function</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\Psi(x, t) = \psi(x)e^{-iEt/\hbar}\]</span></p>

<p>Now, if we assume that <span  class="math">\(E\)</span> is a complex number that takes on the form <span  class="math">\(E_0 + \Gamma i\)</span>, we have</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\Psi(x, t) = \psi(x)e^{-i(E_0 + \Gamma i)t/\hbar} = \psi(x)e^{(-iE_0t + \Gamma t)/\hbar}\]</span></p>

<p>If <span  class="math">\(\Psi\)</span> is normalizable, then</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[ A \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Psi^* \Psi dx = 1\]</span></p>

<p>for some complex number <span  class="math">\(A\)</span>. Substituting in the wave-function, we have</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[ A \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Psi^* \Psi dx = A \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi(x)e^{(iE_0t + \Gamma t)/\hbar} \psi(x)e^{(-iE_0t + \Gamma t)/\hbar} dx = 
A \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi^2 (x) e^{2\Gamma t / \hbar}dx \ \ \ \ \ \ (1)\]</span></p>

<p>The problem here is that if we were to integrate this, the normalization constant <span  class="math">\(A\)</span> would become a function of <span  class="math">\(t\)</span>, meaning it wouldn't be constant, meaning the function
doesn't remain normalized over time. The only way that <span  class="math">\(A\)</span> could remain constant is if <span  class="math">\(\Gamma = 0\)</span>, implying that <span  class="math">\(E\)</span> must be, practically speaking, a real number. <br><br></p>

<p>More generally, the same can easily be shown for non-separable wave-functions (which are simply linear combinations of separable ones). We have</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\Psi(x, t) = \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} c_n \psi_n (x) e^{-i E_n t / \hbar} = \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} c_n \psi_n (x) e^{(-iE_nt + \Gamma_n t)/\hbar}\]</span></p>

<p>Thus, if <span  class="math">\(\Psi\)</span> is normalizable,</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[1 = A \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Psi^* \Psi dx = A \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Psi^* \Psi dx = A \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} 
\left(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} c_n \psi_n (x) e^{(iE_0t + \Gamma t)/\hbar}\right) \left( \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} c_n \psi_n (x) e^{(-iE_0t + \Gamma t)/\hbar} \right) dx\]</span></p>

<p><span  class="math">\[= A \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left(c_1 \psi_1 (x)e^{(iE_1 t + \Gamma_1 t)/\hbar} + \cdots +  c_{\infty} \psi_{\infty} (x)e^{(iE_{\infty} t + \Gamma_{\infty} t)/\hbar}\right) 
\left(c_1 \psi_1 (x)e^{(-iE_1 t + \Gamma_1 t)/\hbar} + \cdots +  c_{\infty} \psi_{\infty} (x)e^{(-iE_{\infty} t + \Gamma_{\infty} t)/\hbar}\right)dx\]</span></p>

<p>The product of these two sums will produce two kinds of terms. One will take on the form of the final expression in <span  class="math">\((1)\)</span>, meaning <span  class="math">\(E\)</span> must be real by the
same logic used before. The second kind of term will contain the product of two or more time-independent wave-functions. I didn't know this as it wasn't yet explained in the textbook,
but when consulting a friend I found out that the product of two time-independent wave-functions (also known as stationary states or energy eigenstates)
must be zero because they are orthogonal.<br><br></p>

<p>Thus, the same condition (<span  class="math">\(\Gamma = 0\)</span>), must be true for any wave-function.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><b>(b)</b> Here, Griffiths specifies that while a time-independent solution can be complex, it can always be represented as a linear combination of
solutions with the same energy that are real. So what he is actually asking us to prove is that the time-independent wave-function can always be represented
as a linear combination of real time-independent wave-functions. <br><br></p>

<p>He points out that if <span  class="math">\(\psi(x)\)</span> satisfies the time-independent Schrödinger equation,</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[-\frac{h^2}{2m}\frac{d^2 \psi}{dx^2}+V\psi = E\psi\]</span></p>

<p>for some given <span  class="math">\(E\)</span>, so must its complex conjugate, and subsequently so must the real linear combinations</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[(\psi + \psi^*) \ \ \ \ \textrm{and} \ \ \ \ i(\psi - \psi^*)\]</span></p>

<p>With this information in mind, we can construct a proof relatively easily. We can define <span  class="math">\(\psi\)</span> as follows:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\psi(x) = a(x) + ib(x)\]</span></p>

<p>Thus,</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[(\psi + \psi^*) = 2a(x) \ \ \ \ \ i(\psi - \psi^*) = -2b(x)\]</span></p>

<p>Here, we have two real wave functions. Expressing <span  class="math">\(\psi\)</span> as a linear combination of <span  class="math">\(2a\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(-2b\)</span>, we have</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\psi(x) = \frac{1}{2} (2a + i 2b) = \frac{1}{2} ((\psi + \psi^*) - i^2(\psi - \psi^*))\]</span></p>

<p>And so we've expresssed <span  class="math">\(\psi\)</span> as a linear combination of two real wave-functions.</p>

<p><b>(c)</b> Once again, it's important to note that what Griffiths means here by &quot;taken to be...&quot; is that
<span  class="math">\(\psi(x)\)</span> can be represented as a <i>linear combination</i> of even and odd solutions. <br><br>
If <span  class="math">\(\psi (x)\)</span> satisfies</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[-\frac{h^2}{2m}\frac{d^2 \psi(x)}{dx^2}+V(x)\psi(x) = E\psi(x),\]</span></p>

<p>then, the same must be true for <span  class="math">\(-x\)</span>, and so (assuming <span  class="math">\(V(x)=V(-x)\)</span>) we have,</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[-\frac{h^2}{2m}\frac{d^2 \psi(-x)}{dx^2}+V(-x)\psi(-x) = -\frac{h^2}{2m}\frac{d^2 \psi(-x)}{dx^2}+V(x)\psi(-x) = E\psi(-x)\]</span></p>

<p>This is important because if <span  class="math">\(V(-x) \neq V(x)\)</span>, then <span  class="math">\(\psi(-x)\)</span> wouldn't satisfy the equation for the same <span  class="math">\(E\)</span> as
<span  class="math">\(\psi(x)\)</span>. <br><br></p>

<p>If both <span  class="math">\(\psi(x)\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(\psi(-x)\)</span> satisfy the time-independent Schrödinger equation, then so must <span  class="math">\(\psi(x) \pm \psi(-x)\)</span>. This gives us
a valid, even solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation,</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\psi(x)' = \psi(x) + \psi(-x)\]</span></p>

<p>and a valid, odd solution</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\psi(x)'' = \psi(x) - \psi(-x)\]</span></p>

<p>where the apostrophies have nothing to do with derivatives and are simply used to differentiate (pun unintended) between the different functions. Since</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\psi(x) = \frac{1}{2}(\psi(x)' + \psi(x)''),\]</span></p>

<p><span  class="math">\(\psi\)</span> is a linear combination of even and odd solutions, and thus <span  class="math">\(\psi\)</span> may as well be taken to be either even or odd.</p>
