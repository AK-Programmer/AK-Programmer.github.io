Show that composition of paths satisfies the following cancellation property: If \(f_0 g_0 \simeq f_1 g_1\) and \(g_0 \simeq g_1\) then \(f_0 \simeq f_1\).
Proof. We first show that \(f_0\) and \(f_1\) have the same endpoints. Since \(f_0 g_0 \simeq f_1 g_1\), \(f_0(0) = f_1(0)\). Since \(g_0 \simeq g_1\), \(g_0(0) = g_1(0)\), and since we&#39;re dealing with path compositions, we know that \(f_0(1) = g_0(0)\) and \(f_1(1) = g_1(0)\), which means \(f_0(1) = f_1(1)\). ">

    <p><strong>Problem 1</strong></p>

<p><em>Show that composition of paths satisfies the following cancellation property: If <span  class="math">\(f_0 g_0 \simeq f_1 g_1\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(g_0 \simeq g_1\)</span> then <span  class="math">\(f_0 \simeq f_1\)</span>.</em></p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> We first show that <span  class="math">\(f_0\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(f_1\)</span> have the same endpoints. Since <span  class="math">\(f_0 g_0 \simeq f_1 g_1\)</span>, <span  class="math">\(f_0(0) = f_1(0)\)</span>. Since <span  class="math">\(g_0 \simeq g_1\)</span>, <span  class="math">\(g_0(0) = g_1(0)\)</span>, and since we're dealing with path compositions, we know that <span  class="math">\(f_0(1) = g_0(0)\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(f_1(1) = g_1(0)\)</span>, which means <span  class="math">\(f_0(1) = f_1(1)\)</span>.</p>

<p>We must then show that there is a homotopy between <span  class="math">\(f_0\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(f_1\)</span>. Our existing homotopy is <span  class="math">\(h: I \times I \to X\)</span>, so then the desired homotopy is simply a reparametrization of the restriction <span  class="math">\(h|[0, 1/2] \times I\)</span> so that its domain is once again <span  class="math">\(I \times I\)</span>.</p>

<p>This directly follows from the definition of path composition, whereby two composed paths are reparametrized so that they can each be 'traversed in half the time', so that they can both be traversed in unit time. As a result, for composable paths <span  class="math">\(f\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(g\)</span>, <span  class="math">\(f g (1/2) = f(1)\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Problem 5</strong>
Show that for a space <span  class="math">\(X\)</span>, the following three conditions are equivalent:</p>

<ol>
<li>Every map <span  class="math">\(S^1 \to X\)</span> is homotopic to a constant map, with image a point</li>
<li>Every map <span  class="math">\(S^1 \to X\)</span> extends to a map <span  class="math">\(D^2 \to X\)</span></li>
<li><span  class="math">\(\pi_1 (X, x_0) = 0\)</span> for all <span  class="math">\(x_0 \in X\)</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Proof.</em> We show that <span  class="math">\(1 \implies 2, 1 \implies 3\)</span>, and <span  class="math">\(3 \implies 1\)</span>.</p>

<p><span  class="math">\(1 \implies 2\)</span>. Given the map <span  class="math">\(f: S^1 \to X\)</span>, our desired extended map is the composition of <span  class="math">\(h_t: S^1 \to X\)</span> with a map <span  class="math">\(g: D^2 \to S^1 \times I\)</span>,
where <span  class="math">\(h_0 = f\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(h_1\)</span> is the constant map. The map <span  class="math">\(g: D^2 \to S^1 \times I\)</span> can be defined like so (so that it is continuous and bijective):</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[g: ((1-r)\cos \theta, (1-r)\sin \theta) \to (\cos \theta, \sin \theta, r)\]</span></p>

<p>for <span  class="math">\(0 \leq r < 1\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(0 \leq \theta \leq 2 \pi\)</span> where <span  class="math">\(r\)</span> is the point's distance from the disk's center, and <span  class="math">\(\theta\)</span> is its angle from 0 on a circle with radius <span  class="math">\(r\)</span>.</p>

<p>As might have notice, this map can't be defined bijectively  for <span  class="math">\((S^1, 1)\)</span> since a point (in this case the center of the disk) can't map to more than one point. But since <span  class="math">\(h_1\)</span> is the constant map, we can simply define <span  class="math">\(hg\)</span> so that the center of the disk maps to the image of <span  class="math">\(h_1\)</span>, and now we have ourselves a unique extension of <span  class="math">\(f\)</span>.</p>

<p>If it isn't intuitively clear why (1) is true, consider a homotopy <span  class="math">\(h_t\)</span> from a loop to a constant map. Now, instead of thinking of this homotopy as 'continuously deforming' a loop to a point, imagine all of the loops in the family <span  class="math">\(h_t\)</span> imbedded in <span  class="math">\(X\)</span> (which can be any surface, but for simplicity we'll say it is a sphere) at once. It should a little clearer how 'combining' all of the loops in <span  class="math">\(h_t\)</span> gives the image of a disk.</p>

<p><br>
<span  class="math">\(1 \implies 3\)</span>. If every map <span  class="math">\(S^1 \to X\)</span> is nullhomotopic, then every such map is homotopic to every other such map by transitivity (assuming <span  class="math">\(X\)</span> is path-connected), meaning there is only one homotopy class in <span  class="math">\(X\)</span>. This is what it means for the fundamental group of a space to be zero.</p>

<p><br>
<span  class="math">\(3 \implies 1\)</span>. If the fundamental group of <span  class="math">\(X\)</span> is zero, then there is one and only one homotopy class. The constant path must be in this homotopy class, for if it isn't, there would be another homotopy class for the constant path, leaving us with two homotopy classes total, which is a contradiction. Every loop is therefore nullhomotopic.
