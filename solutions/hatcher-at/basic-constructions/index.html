Show that composition of paths satisfies the following cancellation property: If \(f_0 g_0 \simeq f_1 g_1\) and \(g_0 \simeq g_1\) then \(f_0 \simeq f_1\).
We first show that \(f_0\) and \(f_1\) have the same endpoints. Since \(f_0 g_0 \simeq f_1 g_1\), \(f_0(0) = f_1(0)\). Since \(g_0 \simeq g_1\), \(g_0(0) = g_1(0)\), and since we&#39;re dealing with path compositions, we know that \(f_0(1) = g_0(0)\) and \(f_1(1) = g_1(0)\), which means \(f_0(1) = f_1(1)\). ">

    <p><strong>Problem 1</strong></p>

<p><em>Show that composition of paths satisfies the following cancellation property: If <span  class="math">\(f_0 g_0 \simeq f_1 g_1\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(g_0 \simeq g_1\)</span> then <span  class="math">\(f_0 \simeq f_1\)</span>.</em></p>

<p>We first show that <span  class="math">\(f_0\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(f_1\)</span> have the same endpoints. Since <span  class="math">\(f_0 g_0 \simeq f_1 g_1\)</span>, <span  class="math">\(f_0(0) = f_1(0)\)</span>. Since <span  class="math">\(g_0 \simeq g_1\)</span>, <span  class="math">\(g_0(0) = g_1(0)\)</span>, and since we're dealing with path compositions, we know that <span  class="math">\(f_0(1) = g_0(0)\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(f_1(1) = g_1(0)\)</span>, which means <span  class="math">\(f_0(1) = f_1(1)\)</span>.</p>

<p>We must then show that there is a homotopy between <span  class="math">\(f_0\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(f_1\)</span>. Our existing homotopy is <span  class="math">\(h: I \times I \to X\)</span>, so then the desired homotopy is simply a reparametrization of the restriction <span  class="math">\(h|[0, 1/2] \times I\)</span> so that its domain is once again <span  class="math">\(I \times I\)</span>.</p>

<p>This directly follows from the definition of path composition, where the two composed paths are reparametrized so that they can be 'traversed in half the time', so that traversing both of them takes unit time. As a result, for composable paths <span  class="math">\(f\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(g\)</span>, <span  class="math">\(f g (1/2) = f(1)\)</span>.</p>
