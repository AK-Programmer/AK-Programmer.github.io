<p>Show that a space <span  class="math">\(X\)</span> is contractible if and only if every map
<span  class="math">\(f: X \rightarrow Y\)</span>, for arbitrary <span  class="math">\(Y\)</span>, is nullhomotopic. Similarly, show <span  class="math">\(X\)</span> is contractible if and only if
every map <span  class="math">\(f: Y \rightarrow X\)</span> is nullhomotopic.
<br><br></p>

<p>I will assume that by 'every map' Hatcher means 'every continuous map'. If <span  class="math">\(X\)</span> is contractible, then its identity map
<span  class="math">\(\mathbb{I}: X \rightarrow X\)</span> is nullhomotopic. Let <span  class="math">\(h: X \times I \rightarrow X\)</span> be a homotopy between <span  class="math">\(\mathbb{I}\)</span> and a constant map
(that's what it means for a function to be nullhomotopic). Then the composite <span  class="math">\(fh: X \times I \rightarrow Y\)</span> is a homotopy from <span  class="math">\(f\)</span> to a constant map. Conversely,
suppose <i>every</i> map <span  class="math">\(f: X \rightarrow Y\)</span> for arbitrary <span  class="math">\(Y\)</span> is nullhomotopic. Then the identity map falls under this category (we can just set <span  class="math">\(Y=X\)</span>), and <span  class="math">\(X\)</span> is
therefore contractible. <br><br></p>

<p>Next, we show that <span  class="math">\(X\)</span> is contractible if and only if every map <span  class="math">\(f: Y \rightarrow X\)</span> is nullhomotopic. Suppose <span  class="math">\(X\)</span> is contractible. Then we can define a homotopy
<span  class="math">\(h: X \times I \rightarrow X\)</span> between the the identity and a constant map. It follows that the composite <span  class="math">\(hf\)</span> is a homotopy between <span  class="math">\(f\)</span> and a constant map (<span  class="math">\(h\)</span> is continuous,
<span  class="math">\(h(f(Y), 0) = f(Y)\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(h(f(Y), 1) = c_0\)</span> for some point <span  class="math">\(c_0 \in X\)</span>. Conversely, if every map <span  class="math">\(f: Y \rightarrow X\)</span> is nullhomotopic, then, setting <span  class="math">\(Y=X\)</span>, the identity map
must also be homotopic. <br><br></p>

<p>I suspect I didn't use the proper notation here for composing functions where the domains of some functions are products, but the logic still holds (I hope!).</p>
