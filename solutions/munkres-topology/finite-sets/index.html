    <p><b>Problem 4: Let <span  class="math">\(A\)</span> be a nonempty finite simply ordered set.</p>

<ul>
<li>(a) Show that <span  class="math">\(A\)</span> has a largest element.</li></li>
<li>(b) Show that <span  class="math">\(A\)</span> has the order type of a section of the positive integers.</li></li>
</ul>

<p></b></p>

<p>Since  <span  class="math">\(A\)</span> is finite and simply ordered, we can
define the order-preserving bijection  <span  class="math">\(f: A \rightarrow \{1,
\ldots, n\}\)</span>. Since <span  class="math">\(n\)</span> is the largest element in the image and
<span  class="math">\(f\)</span> is a bijection, it follows that  <span  class="math">\(f^{-1}(n)\)</span> is the largest
element in <span  class="math">\(A\)</span>. The answer to (b) is fairly obvious since we're able to construct an
order-preserving bijection.</p>

<p><span  class="math">\(\tag*{$\blacksquare$}\)</span>
<br><br></p>

<p><b>Problem 6:</p>

<ul>
<li>(a) Let <span  class="math">\(A = \{1, \ldots, n\}\)</span>. Show there is a bijection of <span  class="math">\(\mathcal{P}(A)\)</span> with the cartesian product <span  class="math">\(X^n\)</span> where <span  class="math">\(X = \{0, 1\}\)</span>.</li></li>
<li>(b) Show that if <span  class="math">\(A\)</span> is finite, then <span  class="math">\(\mathcal{P}(A)\)</span> is finite.</li></li>
</ul>

<p></b></p>

<p>(a) We know that, given <span  class="math">\(A= \{1, \ldots, n\}\)</span>, the cardinality of
<span  class="math">\(\mathcal{P}(A)\)</span> is  <span  class="math">\(2^{n}\)</span>. So we must prove that the
cardinality of <span  class="math">\(X^n\)</span> is also  <span  class="math">\(2^{n}\)</span>. To be thorough, we will
also prove the cardinality of the power set.</p>

<p>Starting with <span  class="math">\(\mathcal{P}(A)\)</span>, given <span  class="math">\(A = \{1\}\)</span>,
<span  class="math">\(\mathcal{P}(A) = \{\varnothing, \{1\}\}\)</span>, which validates our
claim (<span  class="math">\(2^{1} = 2\)</span>). Having shown this for <span  class="math">\(n\)</span>, we show
that this is also true for <span  class="math">\(n+1\)</span>.</p>

<p>Let <span  class="math">\(B = \{1, \ldots, n, n+1\}\)</span>. Then <span  class="math">\(\mathcal{P}(B)\)</span> contains
every <span  class="math">\(s \in \mathcal{P}(A)\)</span>, and, since <span  class="math">\(B = A \cup \{n+1\}\)</span>,
<span  class="math">\(\mathcal{P}(B)\)</span> also contains every <span  class="math">\(s \cup \{n+1\}\)</span> (for every
<span  class="math">\(s \in \mathcal{P}(A)\)</span>, we can define a  <span  class="math">\(s \cup \{n+1\} \in
\mathcal{P}(B)\)</span> ).
Thus, since there are the same number of elements <span  class="math">\(s\)</span> as there
are <span  class="math">\(s \cup\{n+1\}\)</span>, <span  class="math">\(B\)</span>'s cardinality is precisely double the
cardinality of <span  class="math">\(A\)</span>. <br><br></p>

<p>Now onto <span  class="math">\(X^{n}\)</span>. For <span  class="math">\(n=1\)</span>, the cardinality of <span  class="math">\(X^{n}\)</span> is 2,
since <span  class="math">\(X^{1} = X\)</span>.Having shown this is true for <span  class="math">\(n\)</span>, we
show it is true for<span  class="math">\(n+1\)</span>.</p>

<p>Any tuple in  <span  class="math">\(X^{n+1}\)</span> takes on the form <span  class="math">\((x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n,
x_{n+1})\)</span> where the elements <span  class="math">\((x_1, \ldots, x_{n})\)</span> correspond to
a tuple in <span  class="math">\(X^{n}\)</span>. Thus, half the tuples in <span  class="math">\(X^{n+1}\)</span> take on
the form <span  class="math">\((x_1, x_2, \ldots, 0)\)</span>, and half take on the form
<span  class="math">\((x_1, x_2, \ldots, 1)\)</span>, meaning that <span  class="math">\(X^{n+1}\)</span> has double the
cardinality of <span  class="math">\(X^{n}\)</span>. If  <span  class="math">\(|X^{n}|=2^{n}\)</span>, and
<span  class="math">\(|X^{n+1}|=2|X^{n}|\)</span>, then the cardinality of <span  class="math">\(X^{n+1}\)</span> also
follows the <span  class="math">\(2^{n}\)</span> rule.</p>

<p>Thus, since both <span  class="math">\(\mathcal{P}(A)\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(X^{n}\)</span> have the same
cardinality, we can find a bijection between the two sets.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>(b) If <span  class="math">\(A\)</span> is finite, then <span  class="math">\(|A| = n, n \in \mathbb{Z}_+ \implies
|\mathcal{P}(A)| = 2^{n}\)</span>.</p>
