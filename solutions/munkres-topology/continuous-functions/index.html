Problem 1: Prove that for functions
<span  class="math">\(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span>, the
<span  class="math">\(\epsilon-\delta\)</span> definition of continuity implies the open
set definition.
</b></p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p><b>The <span  class="math">\(\epsilon-\delta\)</span> definition:</b> A map <span  class="math">\(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span> is continuous
if for all <span  class="math">\(x\)</span> in the domain,</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \ \delta > 0 \textrm{ such that } |y-x| < \delta \implies |f(y) - f(x)| < \epsilon\]</span></p>

<p><b>The open set definition:</b> Let <span  class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(Y\)</span> be topological spaces.
<span  class="math">\(f: X \rightarrow Y\)</span> is continuous if for each open subset
<span  class="math">\(V\)</span> of <span  class="math">\(Y\)</span>, <span  class="math">\(f^{-1}(V)\)</span> is an open subset of <span  class="math">\(X\)</span>. <br></p>

<p><b>Solution:</b> For some <span  class="math">\(x_0 \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> and some
<span  class="math">\(\epsilon > 0\)</span>, let <span  class="math">\(V = (f(x_0) - \epsilon, f(x_0) + \epsilon)\)</span>. We show that <span  class="math">\(f^{-1}(V)\)</span> is open.
By the <span  class="math">\(\epsilon-\delta\)</span> definition, for any <span  class="math">\(x \in f^{-1}(V)\)</span>, there exists a <span  class="math">\(\delta > 0\)</span> such that
for any <span  class="math">\(y \in (x - \delta, x + \delta)\)</span>, <span  class="math">\(f(y) \in V\)</span>. This means that <span  class="math">\((x - \delta, x + \delta)\)</span> must be
in <span  class="math">\(f^{-1}(V)\)</span>. Since there is such an open set for every <span  class="math">\(x \in f^{-1}(V)\)</span>, <span  class="math">\(f^{-1}(V)\)</span> is a union of open sets and
is therefore open. Since any open set in the codomain is going to be the union of
intervals like <span  class="math">\(V\)</span>, this applies to any open set in the codomain and its inverse.</p>

<p><b>Problem 11:
Let <span  class="math">\(F: X \times Y \rightarrow Z\)</span>. <span  class="math">\(F\)</span> is continuous in each variable separately if
for each <span  class="math">\(y_0\)</span> in <span  class="math">\(Y\)</span>, the map <span  class="math">\(h: X \rightarrow Z\)</span> defined by <span  class="math">\(h(x)=F(x \times y_0)\)</span>
is continuous, and for each <span  class="math">\(x_0\)</span> in <span  class="math">\(X\)</span>, the map <span  class="math">\(k: Y \rightarrow Z\)</span> defined by <span  class="math">\(k(y) = f(x_0 \times y)\)</span>
is continuous. Show that if <span  class="math">\(F\)</span> is continuous, then <span  class="math">\(F\)</span> is continuous in each variable separately.
</b></p>

<p>To prove this we can make use of Theorem 18.2 in the book, which states that if
<span  class="math">\(f:X \rightarrow Y\)</span> is continuous and <span  class="math">\(A\)</span> is a subspace of <span  class="math">\(X\)</span>, then the restricted function
<span  class="math">\(f|A: A \rightarrow Y\)</span> is continuous. In this case, we are restricting the domain to either
<span  class="math">\(X \times {y_0}\)</span>, or <span  class="math">\(x_0 \times Y\)</span> where these new domains inherit the subspace topology from
<span  class="math">\(X \times Y\)</span>.</p>

<br><br></p>

<p><b>Problem 13: Let <span  class="math">\(A \subset X\)</span>; let <span  class="math">\(f: A \rightarrow Y\)</span> be continuous; let <span  class="math">\(Y\)</span> be Hausdorff.
Show that if <span  class="math">\(f\)</span> may be extended to a continuous function <span  class="math">\(g: \overline{A} \rightarrow Y\)</span>, then <span  class="math">\(g\)</span> is
uniquely determined by <span  class="math">\(f\)</span>.

<p>Let's rephrase what this question is asking to make what we must prove a little clearer.</p>
