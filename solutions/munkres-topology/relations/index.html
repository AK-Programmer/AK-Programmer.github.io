    <p><b>Problem 14: If <span  class="math">\(C\)</span> is a relation on set <span  class="math">\(A\)</span>, define a new relation
<span  class="math">\(D\)</span> on <span  class="math">\(A\)</span> by letting <span  class="math">\((b, a) \in D\)</span> if <span  class="math">\((a, b) \in C\)</span>.</p>

<p><b>(a)</b> Prove that <span  class="math">\(C\)</span> is symmetric if and only if <span  class="math">\(C = D\)</span>
<b>(b)</b> Show that if <span  class="math">\(C\)</span> is an order relation, then <span  class="math">\(D\)</span> is an order relation.
<b>(c)</b> Prove that if an ordered set <span  class="math">\(A\)</span> has the greatest lower bound (GLB) property, then it has the least upper bound (LUB) property.</p>

<p><br>
Starting with (a), If <span  class="math">\(D = C\)</span>, then, since <span  class="math">\((b, a) \in D \iff (a, b) \in C\)</span>, <span  class="math">\((b, a) \in C \iff (a, b) \in C\)</span>. This is the definition of symmetry.
Conversely, if <span  class="math">\(C\)</span> is symmetric, then, <span  class="math">\((a, b) \in C \implies (b, a) \in D\)</span>, and, by symmetry, <span  class="math">\((b, a) \in C \implies (a, b) \in D\)</span>,
meaning <span  class="math">\(D=C\)</span>.</p>

<p><br><br>
For (b), all we need to do is ensure that <span  class="math">\(D\)</span> satisfies the conditions of an order relation:</p>

<ul>
<li>If <span  class="math">\((x, x) \not\in C\)</span>, then <span  class="math">\((x, x) \not\in D\)</span></li>
<li>Since, for any given <span  class="math">\(x, y\)</span> where <span  class="math">\(x \neq y\)</span>, either <span  class="math">\(xCy\)</span> or
<span  class="math">\(yCx\)</span> must be true, the same must be true for <span  class="math">\(D\)</span> (if <span  class="math">\(xCy\)</span>, then <span  class="math">\(yDx\)</span>, and vice versa).</li>
<li>Transitivity states that if <span  class="math">\(xCy\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(yCz\)</span>, then <span  class="math">\(xCz\)</span>. Thus, if <span  class="math">\(yDx\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(zDy\)</span>, then <span  class="math">\(zDx\)</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p><br><br>
For (c), consider an ordered set <span  class="math">\(A\)</span> and a subset <span  class="math">\(A_0\)</span> that is bounded above.
Let the set of all of its upper bounds be <span  class="math">\(S\)</span>. <span  class="math">\(S\)</span> is clearly bounded below by <span  class="math">\(A_0\)</span>.
The greatest lower bound property ensures that there is an element <span  class="math">\(b \in A_0\)</span> such that
<span  class="math">\(b \leq x \ \forall \ x \in S\)</span>. Furthermore, the greatest lower bound property ensures that
<span  class="math">\(b\)</span> is the largest element in <span  class="math">\(A_0\)</span> (and subsequently, if in <span  class="math">\(S\)</span>, the smallest element in
<span  class="math">\(S\)</span>). Since <span  class="math">\(x \leq b \ \forall \ x \in A_0\)</span>, <span  class="math">\(b\)</span> is an upper bound of <span  class="math">\(A_0\)</span>. Since it is,
by definition, in <span  class="math">\(S\)</span>, and the smallest element in <span  class="math">\(S\)</span>, <span  class="math">\(S\)</span> has a least upper bound.</p>
