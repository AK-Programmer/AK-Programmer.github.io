    <p><b>Problem 4:</b></p>

<ul>
<li><p>(a) If <span  class="math">\(\{\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\}\)</span> is a family of topologies on <span  class="math">\(X\)</span>, show that <span  class="math">\(\bigcap \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span> is a topology on <span  class="math">\(X\)</span>. Is the same
true for <span  class="math">\(\bigcup \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span>?</p></li>

<li><p>(b) Let <span  class="math">\(\{\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\}\)</span> be a family of topologies on <span  class="math">\(X\)</span>. Show that there is a unique smallest topology on <span  class="math">\(X\)</span> containing all collections
<span  class="math">\(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span>, and a unique largest topology contained in all <span  class="math">\(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><br></p>

<p>(a) All we must do is show that the intersection of the topologies
has the properties of a topology:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><span  class="math">\(\varnothing\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(X\)</span> are clearly in <span  class="math">\(\bigcap
\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span> since they are both in
every <span  class="math">\(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span> by definition.</p></li>

<li><p>Let <span  class="math">\(x, y \in \bigcap
\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span>. Since both
<span  class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(y\)</span> are contained in every
<span  class="math">\(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span>, their union is
also contained in every
<span  class="math">\(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span> by definition.</p></li>

<li><p>Since both <span  class="math">\(x\)</span>
and <span  class="math">\(y\)</span> are contained in every
<span  class="math">\(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span>, their
intersection is also contained in every
<span  class="math">\(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span> by definition.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The same is not true for <span  class="math">\(\bigcup \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span>
unless there is one <span  class="math">\(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span> that
contains all the other topologies. For example, suppose
you have <span  class="math">\(x \in \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(y \in
\mathscr{T}_{\beta}\)</span>. Unless <span  class="math">\(y \in
\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span> or <span  class="math">\(x \in \mathscr{T}_{\beta}\)</span>,
<span  class="math">\(x \cup y\)</span> isn't necessarily in <span  class="math">\(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha} \cup
\mathscr{T}_{\beta}\)</span>,
and so the second condition for a topology is not satisfied.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>(b) The unique largest topology contained in all
<span  class="math">\(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span> would be
<span  class="math">\(\bigcap \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span>, since it is by
definition the largest set which is contained in every
<span  class="math">\(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span>, and it is itself a topology,
as proved above.<br><br></p>

<p>The unique smallest topology containing all
<span  class="math">\(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span>, which we shall call <span  class="math">\(T\)</span>, is the<br>
topology generated
by the subbasis <span  class="math">\(\bigcup \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span>. <br><br></p>

<p>By definition, <span  class="math">\(T\)</span> would contain every <span  class="math">\(x \in
\mathscr{T}_{\alpha} \forall \alpha\)</span>, every possible finite
intersection of <span  class="math">\(\bigcup \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span>, and
every possible union of the finite intersections. <br><br></p>

<p>Now we are left to prove that this is in fact the smallest
topology containing every <span  class="math">\(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span>. <br><br></p>

<p>Suppose <span  class="math">\( T'\)</span> is a topology that is smaller than <span  class="math">\(T\)</span>
and contains all of <span  class="math">\(\{\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\}\)</span>. Then
there must be elements of <span  class="math">\(T\)</span> which are not in <span  class="math">\(T'\)</span>.
If <span  class="math">\(T'\)</span> does not contain any <span  class="math">\(x \in
\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span> for any <span  class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>, then it does
not contain all of <span  class="math">\(\{\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\}\)</span>. If it
does not contain some finite intersection of the elements
of  <span  class="math">\(\bigcup \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span>, then it is not a
topology by definition. If it does not contain some
union of the finite intersections of  <span  class="math">\(\bigcup
\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)</span>, then it is not a topology by
definition. Thus, <span  class="math">\(T\)</span> must be the smallest topology
which contains all of <span  class="math">\(\{\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\}\)</span>.</p>
