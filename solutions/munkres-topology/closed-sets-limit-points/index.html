Problem 5: Let <span  class="math">\(X\)</span> be an ordered set in the order topology.
Show that <span  class="math">\(\overline{(a, b)} \subset [a, b]\)</span>. Under what
conditions does the equality hold?
</b></p>

<p>Theorem 17.6 in the book states that, given a subset
<span  class="math">\(A\)</span> of <span  class="math">\(X\)</span>, and given the set <span  class="math">\(A'\)</span> of all limit points of
<span  class="math">\(A\)</span>, <span  class="math">\(\overline{A} = A \cup A'\)</span>. <span  class="math">\((a, b)\)</span> is clearly in <span  class="math">\([a, b]\)</span>, so we just
need to prove that if <span  class="math">\(x\)</span> is a limit point of <span  class="math">\((a,b)\)</span>, it is in <span  class="math">\([a, b]\)</span>. <br><br></p>

<p>Let <span  class="math">\(x\)</span> be a limit point of <span  class="math">\((a, b)\)</span>, and suppose it is not in <span  class="math">\([a, b]\)</span>. Then,
either <span  class="math">\(x < a\)</span> or <span  class="math">\(x > b\)</span>. This would allow for the existence of neighbourhood(s) of
<span  class="math">\(x\)</span> (such as <span  class="math">\(\{p | p< a\}\)</span> if <span  class="math">\(x < a\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(\{p | p>b\}\)</span> if <span  class="math">\(x>b\)</span>) that do not intersect
any points of<br> <span  class="math">\((a, b)\)</span>, which contradicts our assumption that <span  class="math">\(x\)</span> is a limit point. Thus, any limit
point of <span  class="math">\((a, b)\)</span> must be in <span  class="math">\([a, b]\)</span>.

<p><b>
Problem 12: Show that a subspace of a Hausdorff space is Hausdorff.
</b></p>

<p>Given a Hausdorff space <span  class="math">\(X\)</span>, and <span  class="math">\(A \subset X\)</span>, the subspace topology on
<span  class="math">\(A\)</span> is defined as the collection of all sets <span  class="math">\(A \cap Y\)</span> where <span  class="math">\(Y\)</span> is open in <span  class="math">\(X\)</span>.
Given <span  class="math">\(x, y \in A \subset X\)</span>, since <span  class="math">\(X\)</span> is a Hausdorff space we can define a neighbourhood
<span  class="math">\(U_1\)</span> of <span  class="math">\(x\)</span> in <span  class="math">\(X\)</span> and a neighbourhood <span  class="math">\(U_2\)</span> of <span  class="math">\(y\)</span> in <span  class="math">\(X\)</span> such that the two
neighbourhoods are disjoint. If <span  class="math">\(U_1 \cap U_2 = \varnothing\)</span>, then <span  class="math">\(U_1 \cap A \cap U_2 = \varnothing\)</span>,
and so there are disjoint neighbourhoods of <span  class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(y\)</span> in the subspace topology on <span  class="math">\(A\)</span>, making it a
Hausdorff space.
