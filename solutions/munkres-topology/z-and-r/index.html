    <p><b>Problem 4: Prove by induction that given <span  class="math">\(n \in \mathbb{Z}_+\)</span>, every nonempty subset of <span  class="math">\(\{1, \ldots, n\}\)</span> has a largest element. Explain why you cannot
conclude from this fact that every nonempty subset of <span  class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}_+\)</span> has a largest element.

<p><br>
We can use an argument symmetrical to what Munkres used to prove the well-ordering property. Let
<span  class="math">\(A\)</span> be the set of all <span  class="math">\(n \in \mathbb{Z}_+\)</span> for which <span  class="math">\(S_{n+1} = \{1, \ldots, n\}\)</span> has a largest element.
It follows that <span  class="math">\(n=1\)</span> is in <span  class="math">\(A\)</span> because <span  class="math">\(S_{2} = \{1\}\)</span>, where <span  class="math">\(1\)</span> is the largest element. Now, assuming
what we are trying to prove is true for <span  class="math">\(n\)</span>, we must prove it for <span  class="math">\(n+1\)</span>. Consider a subset <span  class="math">\(C\)</span> of the set
<span  class="math">\(\{1, \ldots, n+1\}\)</span>.. If <span  class="math">\(n+1 \in C\)</span>, then <span  class="math">\(n+1\)</span> is the largest element of <span  class="math">\(C\)</span>. Otherwise, <span  class="math">\(C\)</span> will be
a nonempty subset of <span  class="math">\(\{1, \ldots, n\}\)</span>, and since we assumed any subset of <span  class="math">\(\{1, \ldots, n\}\)</span> has a largest element,
<span  class="math">\(C\)</span> must have a largest element. Thus, having also proved the base case of <span  class="math">\(n=1\)</span>, <span  class="math">\(A\)</span> is inductive and so <span  class="math">\(A = \mathbb{Z}_+\)</span>.
<br> <br>
However, we cannot conclude from this that every nonempty subset of <span  class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}_+\)</span> has a largest element because <span  class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}_+\)</span>
is not bounded above, meaning there can exist subsets of <span  class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}_+\)</span> which are also not bounded above and therefore cannot have a largest element.</p>
