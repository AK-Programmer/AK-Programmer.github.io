    <p><b>Problem:</b> A frictionless tube lies in the vertical plane and is in the shape of a
         function that has its endpoints at the same height but is otherwise arbitrary. 
         A chain with uniform mass per unit length lies in the tube from end to end. Show, by 
         considering the net force of gravity along the curve, that the chain doesnâ€™t move.</p>

    <br>

    <p><b>Solution: </b> Consider an infinitesimal piece of the chain of length \(dl\) with weight \(dm\) (given by \(\rho dl\) where \(\rho\) is mass of the chain per unit length).  The force of gravity at that point 
        would be given by \(gdm = \rho g dl\). The component of this force with which we are concerned is the component that is parallel
        to the tube's surface at this point, as the perpendicular component would be cancelled out by the normal force. <br><br>

        Assuming the inside of the tube's surface is given by a differentiable function \(f\), the slope of the tangent to any point in the 
        tube is given by its derivative, \(\frac{df}{dx}\). Now, in order to capture the steepness of the slope at this point as an angle (which will let us calculate the 
        proportion of \(dmg\) which acts parallel to the tube's surface), we can think of the derivative as the height of a right-triangle with a base of one. <br><br>
        
        The hypotenuse of such a triangle would be \(\sqrt{1+(df/dx)^2}\), and since the component of gravity which acts parallel to an incline is given by 
        \(mg\sin\theta\) where \(\theta\) is the angle the incline makes with the horizontal, the component of gravity which acts parallel to the tube at any point is 
        given by 

        \[\rho g dl \sin\theta = \rho g dl \frac{df/dx}{\sqrt{1+(df/dx)^2}}\]

        Our goal now is to prove that the sum of tangential components of gravity and every point add up to zero. Now, notice that the infinitesimal length \(dl\) is actually equal to the 
        hypotenuse of the triangle hypotenuse above. After all, \(dl\) is the resultant displacement when one takes a step \(dx\) in the horizontal direction and a 
        step \(\frac{df}{dx}dx\) in the vertical direction, and cancelling the \(dx\)'s leaves us with the triangle we had before. Thus, 
        
        \[\rho g dl \frac{df/dx}{\sqrt{1+(df/dx)^2}} = \rho g \sqrt{1+(df/dx)^2} \frac{df/dx}{\sqrt{1+(df/dx)^2}} = \rho g \frac{df}{dx}\]
        
        Remember that this gives us the tangential force of gravity at any point along the chain, meaning that integrating this function along the entire chain must give us the net 
        tangential force of gravity: 

        \[\rho g \int_a^b \frac{df}{dx} = f(b) - f(a)\]

        where \(a\) and \(b\) are the locations of the endpoints along the \(x\) axis. Remembering that the two ends of tube are the same height, 

        \[f(b)-f(a) = 0,\]

        proving that all the forces on the chain cancel out!
