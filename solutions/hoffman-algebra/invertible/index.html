    <meta name="description" content="Theorem. If \(A\) is an \(m \times n\) matrix, \(B\) is an \(n \times m\) matrix, and \(n , then \(AB\) is not invertible.
Proof. If \(AB\) is invertible, then the homogenous system \(ABX = 0\) has only the trivial solution \(X=0\). By Theorem 6 [1], \(B\) must have a non-trivial solution since it has less rows than columns. Since \(AB\) is a product of \(B\) with \(B\) on the right side, the rows of \(AB\) are linear combinations of the rows of \(B\), and so it must have the same solutions as \(B\) (and therefore a non-trivial one).

    <p><strong>Theorem.</strong> If <span  class="math">\(A\)</span> is an <span  class="math">\(m \times n\)</span> matrix, <span  class="math">\(B\)</span> is an <span  class="math">\(n \times m\)</span> matrix, and <span  class="math">\(n < m\)</span>, then <span  class="math">\(AB\)</span> is not invertible.</p>

<p><em>Proof.</em> If <span  class="math">\(AB\)</span> is invertible, then the homogenous system <span  class="math">\(ABX = 0\)</span> has only the trivial solution <span  class="math">\(X=0\)</span>.
By Theorem 6 [1],  <span  class="math">\(B\)</span> must have a non-trivial solution since it has less rows than columns. Since <span  class="math">\(AB\)</span> is a product of <span  class="math">\(B\)</span> with <span  class="math">\(B\)</span> on the right side,
the rows of <span  class="math">\(AB\)</span> are linear combinations of the rows of <span  class="math">\(B\)</span>, and so it must have the same solutions as <span  class="math">\(B\)</span> (and therefore a non-trivial one).
Thus, <span  class="math">\(AB\)</span> does not have <span  class="math">\(X=0\)</span> as its only solution, and so it is not invertible.</p>

<p>[1] Theorem 6 is the following: If <span  class="math">\(A\)</span> is an <span  class="math">\(m \times n\)</span> matrix with <span  class="math">\(m < n\)</span>, then the homogenous system <span  class="math">\(AX = 0\)</span> has a non-trivial solution.</p>
