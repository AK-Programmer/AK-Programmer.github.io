            Problem 1: Prove that for functions 
            \(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\), the 
            \(\epsilon-\delta\) definition of continuity implies the open 
            set definition.
        </b><br><br>
        
        The \(\epsilon-\delta\) definition: A map \(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) is continuous 
        if for all \(x\) in the domain, 

        \[\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \ \delta > 0 \textrm{ such that } |y-x| < \delta \implies |f(y) - f(x)| < \epsilon\]

        The open set definition: Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces. 
        \(f: X \rightarrow Y\) is continuous if for each open subset 
        \(V\) of \(Y\), \(f^{-1}(V)\) is an open subset of \(X\). <br>

        <div class="proof">
            For some \(x_0 \in \mathbb{R}\) and some 
            \(\epsilon > 0\), let \(V = (f(x_0) - \epsilon, f(x_0) + \epsilon)\). We show that \(f^{-1}(V)\) is open. 
            By the \(\epsilon-\delta\) definition, for any \(x \in f^{-1}(V)\), there exists a \(\delta > 0\) such that 
            for any \(y \in (x - \delta, x + \delta)\), \(f(y) \in V\). This means that \((x - \delta, x + \delta)\) must be 
            in \(f^{-1}(V)\). Since there is such an open set for every \(x \in f^{-1}(V)\), \(f^{-1}(V)\) is a union of open sets and 
            is therefore open. Since any open set in the codomain is going to be the union of 
            intervals like \(V\), this applies to any open set in the codomain and its inverse.

        <b>Problem 11:
        Let \(F: X \times Y \rightarrow Z\). \(F\) is continuous in each variable separately if 
        for each \(y_0\) in \(Y\), the map \(h: X \rightarrow Z\) defined by \(h(x)=F(x \times y_0)\) 
        is continuous, and for each \(x_0\) in \(X\), the map \(k: Y \rightarrow Z\) defined by \(k(y) = f(x_0 \times y\) 
        is continuous. Show that if \(F\) is continuous, then \(F\) is continuous in each variable separately. 
        </b> 


        <div class="proof">
            To prove this we can make use of Theorem 18.2 in the book, which states that if 
            \(f:X \rightarrow Y\) is continuous and \(A\) is a subspace of \(X\), then the restricted function 
            \(f|A: A \rightarrow Y\) is continuous. In this case, we are restricting the domain to either 
            \(X \times {y_0}\), or \(x_0 \times Y\) where these new domains inherit the subspace topology from 
            \(X \times Y\).
