    <p> <b>Problem 11:
        Let \(F: X \times Y \rightarrow Z\). \(F\) is continuous in each variable separately if 
        for each \(y_0\) in \(Y\), the map \(h: X \rightarrow Z\) defined by \(h(x)=F(x \times y_0)\) 
        is continuous, and for each \(x_0\) in \(X\), the map \(k: Y \rightarrow Z\) defined by \(k(y) = f(x_0 \times y\) 
        is continuous. Show that if \(F\) is continuous, then \(F\) is continuous in each variable separately. 
        </b> 


        <div class="proof">
            To prove this we can make use of Theorem 18.2 in the book, which states that if 
            \(f:X \rightarrow Y\) is continuous and \(A\) is a subspace of \(X\), then the restricted function 
            \(f|A: A \rightarrow Y\) is continuous. In this case, we are restricting the domain to either 
            \(X \times {y_0}\), or \(x_0 \times Y\) where these new domains inherit the subspace topology from 
            \(X \times Y\).
