            Problem 5: Let \(X\) be an ordered set in the order topology. 
            Show that \(\overline{(a, b)} \subset [a, b]\). Under what 
            conditions does the equality hold?
        </b>

        <div class="proof">
            Theorem 17.6 in the book states that, given a subset 
            \(A\) of \(X\), and given the set \(A'\) of all limit points of 
            \(A\), \(\overline{A} = A \cup A'\). \((a, b)\) is clearly in \([a, b]\), so we just 
            need to prove that if \(x\) is a limit point of \((a,b)\), it is in \([a, b]\). <br><br>

            Let \(x\) be a limit point of \((a, b)\), and suppose it is not in \([a, b]\). Then, 
            either \(x < a\) or \(x > b\). This would allow for the existence of neighbourhood(s) of 
            \(x\) (such as \(\{p | p< a\}\) if \(x < a\) and \(\{p | p>b\}\) if \(x>b\)) that do not intersect 
            any points of<br> \((a, b)\), which contradicts our assumption that \(x\) is a limit point. Thus, any limit 
            point of \((a, b)\) must be in \([a, b]\).
