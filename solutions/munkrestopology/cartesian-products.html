    <p> <b>Problem 1: Show there is a bijective correspondence of \(A \times B\) with \(B \times A\)</b> 
        <br>
        <div class="proof"> Since \((a, b) \in A \times B \iff (b, a) \in B \times A\), we can map any element
            \((a, b)\) to the element  \((b, a)\) and vice versa, and so there is clearly a bijective
            correspondence between the two sets.

        <b>Problem 3: Let \(A = A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots\) and \(B = B_1 \times B_2 \times \cdots\)</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>(a) Show that if \(B_i \subset A_i\) for all \(i\), then \(B \subset A\)</b></li>
            <li><b>(b) Show the converse of (a) holds if \(B\) is nonempty.</b></li>
            <li><b>(c) Show that if \(A\) is nonempty, each \(A_i\) is nonempty. Does the converse hold?</b></li>
            <li><b>(d) What is the relation between the set \(A \cup B\) and the cartesian product 
                \[\prod\limits_{i \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}}
                A_{i} \cup B_{i}.\]

                What is the relation between the set \(A \cap B\) and the cartesian product
                \[\prod\limits_{i \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}}
                A_{i} \cap B_{i}.\]
            </b></li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="proof">
            (a) Remembering that 

            \[\prod\limits_{i \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}} S_{i} = S_1 \times S_2 \times \cdots\] 

            is defined as the set of all \(\omega\)-tuples  \((\omega_1, \omega_2,
            \cdots)\) of elements of \(S_1 \cup S_2 \cup \cdots\) such that \(\omega_1
            \in S_1, \omega_2 \in S_2, \cdots\), it follows that for any given
            \(\omega_{i} \in B_{i}\), \(\omega_{i}\) must also be in \(A_{i}\), and so any
            \((\omega_1, \omega_2, \cdots) \in B\) must also be in \(A\).
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
            (b) Suppose \(B \subset A\) and \(B \subset A \not\Longrightarrow B_{i}
            \subset A_{i} \ \forall i\). That would allow for the existence of some
            \(\omega\)-tuple  \(\omega\) such that \(\omega_i \in B_1 \cup B_2 \cup \cdots\) and
            \(\omega_{i} \not\in A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots\). This is a clear contradiction, as
            such a tuple would be an element of \(B\) and not an element of \(A\). 
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
            (c) Suppose \(A_{k} =
	        \varnothing\) for some \(k \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}\). Then, since \(A\) is
	        defined as the set of all \(\omega\)-tuples such that \(\omega_{i}
	        \in A_{i}\), and since there is no element \(\omega_{k}\) such
	        that \(\omega_{k} \in A_{k}\), there can be no such tuple. Thus,
	        Every \(A_{i}\) must be nonempty. The converse is also true. If
	        each \(A_{i}\) is nonempty, then there are elements \(\omega_{i} \in
	        A_{i}\) for each \(i\), and so the  \(\omega\)-tuple \(\omega\) can
	        exist. 
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
            (d) In short, \(A \cup B \subset \prod\limits_{i \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}}
            A_{i} \cup B_{i}\). This is because the latter contains all of \(A\) and all
            of \(B\), but can also contain elements not in either; tuples which contain
            elements from both \(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots\) and \(B_1 \cup B_2 \cup
            \cdots\), may not be in either, for example. (I know this isn't a rigorous
            "proof", but it's 2 in the morning and I'm tired). 


            On the other hand, \(\prod\limits_{i \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}}
            A_{i} \cap B_{i} = A \cap B\):

            \[\omega \in A \cap B \iff \omega \in A \textrm{ and } \omega \in B \iff \omega_i \in
            A_i \textrm{ and } \omega_{i} \in B_{i} \ \forall i \iff \omega \in \prod\limits_{i \in \mathbb{Z}_{+}} A_{i} \cap B_i\]

        </div>
