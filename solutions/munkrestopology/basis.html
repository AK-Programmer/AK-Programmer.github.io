    <p> <b>Problem 4:
        <ul>
            <li>
                (a) If \(\{\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\}\) is a family of topologies on \(X\), show that \(\bigcap \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\) is a topology on \(X\). Is the same
                true for \(\bigcup \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)?
            </li>

            <li>
                (b) Let \(\{\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\}\) be a family of topologies on \(X\). Show that there is a unique smallest topology on \(X\) containing all collections 
                \(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\), and a unique largest topology contained in all \(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\). 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </b> 

        <br>
        <div class="proof">
            (a) All we must do is show that the intersection of the topologies
            has the properties of a topology: 
            <ol>
                <li>
                    \(\varnothing\) and \(X\) are clearly in \(\bigcap
                    \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\) since they are both in
                    every \(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\) by definition. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let \(x, y \in \bigcap
                    \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\). Since both
                    \(x\) and \(y\) are contained in every
                    \(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\), their union is
                    also contained in every
                    \(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\) by definition. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Since both \(x\) 
                    and \(y\) are contained in every
                    \(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\), their
                    intersection is also contained in every
                    \(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\) by definition. 
                </li>
            </ol>

            The same is not true for \(\bigcup \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)
            unless there is one \(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\) that
            contains all the other topologies. For example, suppose
            you have \(x \in \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\) and \(y \in
            \mathscr{T}_{\beta}\). Unless \(y \in
            \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\) or \(x \in \mathscr{T}_{\beta}\), 
            \(x \cup y\) isn't necessarily in \(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha} \cup
            \mathscr{T}_{\beta}\), 
            and so the second condition for a topology is not satisfied. 
        </div>
        
        <br>
        <div class="proof">
            (b) The unique largest topology contained in all
            \(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\) would be
            \(\bigcap \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\), since it is by
            definition the largest set which is contained in every
            \(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\), and it is itself a topology,
            as proved <br><br>
        
            The unique smallest topology containing all
            \(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\) would be the collection 
            \[
            T = \bigcup
            \mathscr{T}_{\alpha} \cup \{x \subset X \ | \ x = y \cup z
            \textrm{ for some } y \in \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}, z \in
            \mathscr{T}_{\beta}\} \cup \{a \subset X \ | \ a = y \cap z
            \textrm{ for some } y \in \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}, z \in
            \mathscr{T}_{\beta}\}
            .\] 
        
            This is in fact a topology, as one can check. All that is left
            to show is that it is the smallest topology containing all of
            \(\{\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\}\). <br><br>
        
            Suppose there was a topology \(T'\) which contained all of
            \(\{\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\}\) and was smaller than \(T\). This
            would imply that \(T\) contains elements which aren't in \(T'\).
        
            If \(T'\) doesn't contain some or all elements of \(\bigcup
            \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\), then it doesn't contain every
            \(T_{\alpha}\), and so we have a contradiction. 
        
            If \(T'\) doesn't contain some or all elements of \(\{x \subset X | \ x = y \cup z \textrm{ for some } y \in \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}, z \in
            \mathscr{T}_{\beta}\}\), then it's not a topology as not all
            unions of elements of \(T\) are in \(T\). The same applies to
            \(\{a \subset X \ | \ a = y \cap z
            \textrm{ for some } y \in \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}, z \in
            \mathscr{T}_{\beta}\}\). Thus, there can be no topology smaller
            than \(T\) that contains all of \(\{\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\}\)
            \end{proof}
