        <b>Problem 4: Let \(A\) be a nonempty finite simply ordered set.
            <ul>
                <li>(a) Show that \(A\) has a largest element.</li>
                <li>(b) Show that \(A\) has the order type of a section of the positive integers.</li>
            </ul>
        </b>

        <div class="proof">
                Since  \(A\) is finite and simply ordered, we can
                define the order-preserving bijection  \(f: A \rightarrow \{1,
                \ldots, n\}\). Since \(n\) is the largest element in the image and
                \(f\) is a bijection, it follows that  \(f^{-1}(n)\) is the largest
                element in \(A\). The answer to (b) is fairly obvious since we're able to construct an
                order-preserving bijection.

        <b>Problem 6:
            <ul>
                <li>(a) Let \(A = \{1, \ldots, n\}\). Show there is a bijection of \(\mathcal{P}(A)\) with the cartesian product \(X^n\) where \(X = \{0, 1\}\).</li>
                <li>(b) Show that if \(A\) is finite, then \(\mathcal{P}(A)\) is finite.</li>
            </ul>
        </b>

        <div class="proof">
            (a) 
            We know that, given \(A= \{1, \ldots, n\}\), the cardinality of
            \(\mathcal{P}(A)\) is  \(2^{n}\). So we must prove that the
            cardinality of \(X^n\) is also  \(2^{n}\). To be thorough, we will
            also prove the cardinality of the power set.

            Starting with \(\mathcal{P}(A)\), given \(A = \{1\}\),
            \(\mathcal{P}(A) = \{\varnothing, \{1\}\}\), which validates our
            claim (\(2^{1} = 2\)). Having shown this for \(n\), we show
            that this is also true for \(n+1\).

            Let \(B = \{1, \ldots, n, n+1\}\). Then \(\mathcal{P}(B)\) contains
            every \(s \in \mathcal{P}(A)\), and, since \(B = A \cup \{n+1\}\),
            \(\mathcal{P}(B)\) also contains every \(s \cup \{n+1\}\) (for every
            \(s \in \mathcal{P}(A)\), we can define a  \(s \cup \{n+1\} \in
            \mathcal{P}(B)\) ). 
            Thus, since there are the same number of elements \(s\) as there 
            are \(s \cup\{n+1\}\), \(B\)'s cardinality is precisely double the 
            cardinality of \(A\). <br><br>

            Now onto \(X^{n}\). For \(n=1\), the cardinality of \(X^{n}\) is 2, 
            since \(X^{1} = X\).Having shown this is true for \(n\), we
            show it is true for\(n+1\). 

            Any tuple in  \(X^{n+1}\) takes on the form \((x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n,
            x_{n+1})\) where the elements \((x_1, \ldots, x_{n})\) correspond to
            a tuple in \(X^{n}\). Thus, half the tuples in \(X^{n+1}\) take on
            the form \((x_1, x_2, \ldots, 0)\), and half take on the form
            \((x_1, x_2, \ldots, 1)\), meaning that \(X^{n+1}\) has double the
            cardinality of \(X^{n}\). If  \(|X^{n}|=2^{n}\), and
            \(|X^{n+1}|=2|X^{n}|\), then the cardinality of \(X^{n+1}\) also
            follows the \(2^{n}\) rule. 

            Thus, since both \(\mathcal{P}(A)\) and \(X^{n}\) have the same
            cardinality, we can find a bijection between the two sets.
        </div>

        <div class="proof">
            (b) If \(A\) is finite, then \(|A| = n, n \in \mathbb{Z}_+ \implies
            |\mathcal{P}(A)| = 2^{n}\).
