    <p> <b>Problem 13: Prove the following</b> 
        <div class="theorem">If an ordered set \(A\) has the least upper bound property, then it has the greatest lower bound property.</div>
        
        <br>
        <div class="proof">
            Consider a subset \(A_0 \subset A\) where \(A\) is a set that is, say, 
            bounded above (although this argument works equally well if it's bounded below). If this set <b>doesn't have</b> a 
            least upper bound (which often the elements in the set of upper bounds converge on some element but never actually "reach" it), 
            then there exists an element \(a \not\in A\) that is the least upper bound. <br><br>

            \(a\) could then also serve as the element on which a set of lower bounds for 
            some subset \(A_0 \subset A\) converges, precluding the existence of the greatest lower bound property in 
            \(A\). If this condition is not true (which is implied by the least upper bound property), all subsets of \(A\) with lower 
            bounds will have a greatest lower bound.
