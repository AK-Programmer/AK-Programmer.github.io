    <p> <b>Problem 14: If \(C\) is a relation on set \(A\), define a new relation 
        \(D\) on \(A\) by letting \((b, a) \in D\) if \((a, b) \in C\). </b> 

        <ul>
            <li><b>(a)</b> Prove that \(C\) is symmetric if and only if \(C = D\)</li>
            <li><b>(b)</b> Show that if \(C\) is an order relation, then \(D\) is an order relation.</li>
            <li><b>(c)</b> Prove that if an ordered set \(A\) has the greatest lower bound (GLB) property, then it has the least upper bound (LUB) property.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <br>
        <div class="proof"> Starting with (a), If \(D = C\), then, since \((b, a) \in D \iff (a, b) \in C\), \((b, a) \in C \iff (a, b) \in C\). This is the definition of symmetry.
            Conversely, if \(C\) is symmetric, then, \((a, b) \in C \implies (b, a) \in D\), and, by symmetry, \((b, a) \in C \implies (a, b) \in D\), 
            meaning \(D=C\). 
        </div>

        <br><br>
        <div class="proof">For (b), all we need to do is ensure that \(D\) satisfies the conditions of an order relation:
            <ul>
                <li>If \((x, x) \not\in C\), then \((x, x) \not\in D\)</li>
                <li>Since, for any given \(x, y\) where \(x \neq y\), either \(xCy\) or 
                    \(yCx\) must be true, the same must be true for \(D\) (if \(xCy\), then \(yDx\), and vice versa).
                </li>

                <li>Transitivity states that if \(xCy\) and \(yCz\), then \(xCz\). Thus, if \(yDx\) and \(zDy\), then \(zDx\).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <div class="proof"> For (c), consider an ordered set \(A\) and a subset \(A_0\) that is bounded above. 
            Let the set of all of its upper bounds be \(S\). \(S\) is clearly bounded below by \(A_0\). 
            The greatest lower bound property ensures that there is an element \(b \in A_0\) such that 
            \(b \leq x \ \forall \ x \in S\). Furthermore, the greatest lower bound property ensures that 
            \(b\) is the largest element in \(A_0\) (and subsequently, if in \(S\), the smallest element in 
            \(S\). Since \(x \leq b \ \forall \ x \in A_0\), \(b\) is an upper bound of \(A_0\). Since it is, 
            by definition, in \(S\), and the smallest element in \(S\), \(S\) has a least upper bound.
