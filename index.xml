      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about what I want to do with my life, as one does. Thus far, the answer is, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure&amp;rdquo;.
There are a bunch of things I really enjoy doing, but I can&amp;rsquo;t see myself dedicating my entire life to any one of them. In a world where one is supposed to become highly competent at one or two skills and sort of “do their thing” until they can’t anymore, I find myself yearning for more.</description>

      <description>July 2020   Math stuff. I started learning topology. I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading Munkres&amp;rsquo;s book on the subject to learn about the fundamentals of point-set topology. I also started reading Hatcher&amp;rsquo;s book on algebraic topology as well as Pinter&amp;rsquo;s book on abstract algebra. My goal is to have a solid foundation in algebraic topology and algebra in a few months. I&amp;rsquo;ve been posting some solutions to problems I&amp;rsquo;ve done in Munkres&amp;rsquo;s book here.</description>

      <description>Problem 10 Show that a space \(X\) is contractible if and only if every map \(f: X \rightarrow Y\), for arbitrary \(Y\), is nullhomotopic. Similarly, show \(X\) is contractible if and only if every map \(f: Y \rightarrow X\) is nullhomotopic. f \(X\) is contractible, then its identity map \(\mathbb{I}: X \rightarrow X\) is nullhomotopic. Let \(h: X \times I \rightarrow X\) be a homotopy between \(\mathbb{I}\) and a constant map (This map exists since the identity is nullhomotopic).</description>

      <description>Section 20, Problem 8
Let \(X\) be the subset of \(\mathbb{R}^{\omega}\) consisting of all sequences such that \(\sum x^2_i\) converges. Then the formula
\[d(\textbf{x}, \textbf{y}) = \left[\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty} (x_i - y_i)^2\right]^{1/2}\]
defines a metric on \(X\). \(X\) can inheret a subspace topology from the box, product, and uniform topologies on \(\mathbb{R}^{\omega}\) and it also has the topology given by \(d\), called the \(\ell^2\)-topology.
 (a) Show that on \(X\), we have inclusions \(\textrm{box topology } \supset \ell^2 \textrm{-topology } \supset \textrm{ uniform topology}\)</description>

      <description>Problem 1: Prove that for functions \(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\), the \(\epsilon-\delta\) definition of continuity implies the open set definition. 

The \(\epsilon-\delta\) definition: A map \(f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) is continuous if for all \(x\) in the domain,
\[\forall \epsilon  0, \exists \ \delta  0 \textrm{ such that } |y-x| The open set definition: Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces. \(f: X \rightarrow Y\) is continuous if for each open subset \(V\) of \(Y\), \(f^{-1}(V)\) is an open subset of \(X\).</description>

      <description>Problem 5: Let \(X\) be an ordered set in the order topology. Show that \(\overline{(a, b)} \subset [a, b]\). Under what conditions does the equality hold? 
Theorem 17.6 in the book states that, given a subset \(A\) of \(X\), and given the set \(A&#39;\) of all limit points of \(A\), \(\overline{A} = A \cup A&#39;\). \((a, b)\) is clearly in \([a, b]\), so we just need to prove that if \(x\) is a limit point of \((a,b)\), it is in \([a, b]\).</description>

      <description>Problem 4:
 (a) If \(\{\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\}\) is a family of topologies on \(X\), show that \(\bigcap \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\) is a topology on \(X\). Is the same true for \(\bigcup \mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\)?
 (b) Let \(\{\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\}\) be a family of topologies on \(X\). Show that there is a unique smallest topology on \(X\) containing all collections \(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\), and a unique largest topology contained in all \(\mathscr{T}_{\alpha}\).
  
(a) All we must do is show that the intersection of the topologies has the properties of a topology:</description>

      <description>Problem 4: Let \(A\) be a nonempty finite simply ordered set.
 (a) Show that \(A\) has a largest element. (b) Show that \(A\) has the order type of a section of the positive integers.  
Since \(A\) is finite and simply ordered, we can define the order-preserving bijection \(f: A \rightarrow \{1, \ldots, n\}\). Since \(n\) is the largest element in the image and \(f\) is a bijection, it follows that \(f^{-1}(n)\) is the largest element in \(A\).</description>

      <description>Problem 1: Show there is a bijective correspondence of \(A \times B\) with \(B \times A\) Since \((a, b) \in A \times B \iff (b, a) \in B \times A\), we can map any element \((a, b)\) to the element \((b, a)\) and vice versa, and so there is clearly a bijective correspondence between the two sets. \(\tag*{$\blacksquare$}\)

Problem 3: Let \(A = A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots\) and \(B = B_1 \times B_2 \times \cdots\)</description>

      <description>Problem 4: Prove by induction that given \(n \in \mathbb{Z}_+\), every nonempty subset of \(\{1, \ldots, n\}\) has a largest element. Explain why you cannot conclude from this fact that every nonempty subset of \(\mathbb{Z}_+\) has a largest element. 

We can use an argument symmetrical to what Munkres used to prove the well-ordering property. Let \(A\) be the set of all \(n \in \mathbb{Z}_+\) for which \(S_{n+1} = \{1, \ldots, n\}\) has a largest element.</description>

(a) Prove that \(C\) is symmetric if and only if \(C = D\) (b) Show that if \(C\) is an order relation, then \(D\) is an order relation. (c) Prove that if an ordered set \(A\) has the greatest lower bound (GLB) property, then it has the least upper bound (LUB) property.</description>

 (a) Show that \(A_0 \subset f^{-1}(f(A_0))\) and that equality holds if \(f\) is injective. (b) Show that \(f(f^{-1}(B_0)) \subset B_0\) and that equality holds if \(f\) is surjective.  
Let&#39;s start off by defining \(f\) and \(f^{-1}\). Given \(f: A \rightarrow B\), \(A_0 \subset A\), and \(B_0 \subset B\), \(f(A_0) = \{b \ | \ b=f(a) \ \textrm{for at least one}\ a \in A_0\}\) \(f^{-1}(B_0)=\{ a \ | \ f(a) \in B_0 \}\)</description>

\[A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A\cap C)\]

      <description>Ever since I can remember, I&amp;rsquo;ve questioned the orthodoxy around me. It started with questioning the existence of a God, which my family assured me was real, and has progressed to questioning all sorts of opinions, ideologies, and beliefs.
While I have a few deeply held convictions, most of my opinions are loosely-held, and often I have a hard time forming opinions which I consider a truly fair conclusion to a rigorous analysis of the issues at hand.</description>

      <description>Problem: Prove the following three theorems (a) For normalizable solutions, the separation constant \(E\) must be real. (b) The time-independent wave-function \(\psi(x)\) can always be taken to be real (unlike \(\Psi (x, t)\)) (c) If \(V(x)\) is an even function (that is, \(V(x)=V(-x)\)), then \(\psi(x)\) can always be taken to be either even or odd.
Solution: 
(a) We have the wave-function
\[\Psi(x, t) = \psi(x)e^{-iEt/\hbar}\]
Now, if we assume that \(E\) is a complex number that takes on the form \(E_0 + \Gamma i\), we have</description>

      <description>Problem: Suppose you wanted to describe an unstable particle, that spontaneously disintegrates with a &#39;lifetime&#39; \(\tau\). In that case the total probability of finding the particle somewhere should not be constant, but should decrease at an exponential rate:
\[P(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\Psi(x, t)|^2 dx = e^{-t/\tau}.\]
If
\[V = V_0 - i\Gamma,\]
where \(V_0\) is the true potential energy and \(\Gamma\) is a positive real constant.
 (a) Show that, in place of \(dP/dt = 0\), as with a &amp;quot;stable particle&amp;quot;, we now get \(\frac{dP}{dt} = - \frac{2\Gamma}{\hbar}P\) (b) Solve for \(P(t)\), and find the lifetime of the particle in terms of \(\Gamma\)</description>

      <description>Problem: Show that \(\frac{d\langle p \rangle}{dt} = \left\langle - \frac{\partial V}{\partial x}\right\rangle .\)
Solution:  In the book, Griffiths derives momentum to be
\[\langle p \rangle = m \frac{d\langle x \rangle}{dt} = -i\hbar \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left(\Psi^* \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial x}\right)dx\]
And so we have
\[\frac{d \langle p \rangle}{dt} = m \frac{d^2\langle x \rangle}{dt^2} = -i\hbar \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\Psi^* \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial x}\right)dx\]
\[= -i\hbar \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left( \frac{\partial \Psi^*}{\partial t} \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial x} + \Psi^* \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial x}\right)\right)dx\]</description>

      <description>In single-variable calculus, we can integrate functions of the form
\[g&#39;(x)f(g(x))\]
by &#39;rephrasing&#39; the entire integral as an integral of \(g(x)\) instead of an integral of \(x\). This is known as substitution. For example, consider the following integral:
\[\int x e^{x^2} dx\]
Integrating this function as it currently is is painfully annoying, and so Leibniz, one of the fathers of calculus, came up with a way to simplify this integral. The first step in doing so is to notice that</description>

      <description>Problem Consider the wave function
\[\Psi (x,t)=Ae^{-\lambda |x|}e^{-i\omega t},\]
where \(A\), \(\lambda\), and \(\omega\) are positive real constants. Normalize \(\Psi\), determine the expectation values of \(x\) and \(x^2\), and find the standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) of \(x\). What is the probability the particle would be found outside the range \(-\sigma \leq x \leq \sigma\).
Solution:  First, to normalize \(\Psi\) means to find \(A\) such that
\[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\Psi (x, t)|^2 dx = 1,\]</description>
